<h2>The Scryline Manifesto</h2>

<p>
Our world has splintered into different realities. As 2020's pandemic and
election show, what we once thought of as "the news" has fragmented into a
bewildering kaleidoscope of traditional media articles, online upstarts,
scientific studies, legal filings, experts / pundits on Twitter, eyewitness
YouTube clips, hectoring YouTube lectures, Medium posts, Substack newsletters,
Reddit threads, and more.
</p>

<p>
Today's readers pick and choose their news as if from a buffet. Those who
subscribe to alternate realities will not be brought back by the offer of
a few random morsels from the real world. To do that, you need the thing our
media kaleidoscope lacks: <i>context</i>. Citations showing how real news is a
self-consistent web of interlocking facts and evidence, whereas bad-faith
"news" is incoherent, often self-contradictory, and draws no distinction
between allegations, insinuations, and actual evidence. That context is what
Scryline is meant to help provide.
</p>
    
<p>
Modern journalism does not currently excel at this, due to inherent blind spots:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Journalists remain loath to link to primary sources, much less competitors' articles.</li>
    <li>Journalists still have a "dead tree" attitude towards what they publish:
        articles are individual, self-contained, and set in stone but for corrections, rather than
        connected nodes in a network of living (versioned) documents.</li>
    <li>The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers after publication is unthinkable anathema.</li>
    <li>Aggregation and synthesis of others' articles is considered inferior, low-class work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not merely useful; in
today's fragmented media world, to provide real context and understanding, it
is <i>essential</i>. This makes tools which enable collaborative aggregation highly
desirable. People try to use Twitter threads, Wikipedia lists, Reddit posts,
etc., but none are well designed for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious and intuitive form of aggregation is an <i>annotated timeline</i>,
in which articles, papers, tweets, preprints, blog posts, etc., are arranged
in (mostly) chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for such timelines.
</p>

<p>
Scryline is also built atop <i>self-hosted data</i>. Its timelines are stored as
YAML, a human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single
common public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use
personal and/or private repos. As such, Scryline's data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>will always be accessible to its users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish</li>
    <li>is automatically available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich UI and API</li>
    <li>natively incorporates GitHub's collaborative "fork / pull-request / merge" paradigm</li>
    <li>is very easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.</li>
</ul>

<p>The word "scry" means "<em>to use divination to discover hidden knowledge or future events</em>."</p>
